      Semantic segmentation is the task consisting in classifying all the pixels
      of an image into different predefined classes. It has many usecases, in
      particular for medical images, where segmentation (implicitely or
      explicitely) is often a prerequisite to the diagnosis. The segmented
      structures, either healthy or pathological, have many shapes and sizes. A
      lot of research is dedicated to developping models for automatically
      segmenting these.

    This website has been conceived to provide an intuitive understanding of
    different segmentation metrics. Two canvas are provided to draw a reference
    and a <i>simulated</i> prediction. Metrics are computed on the fly and by
    hovering over them, a quick tutorial is provided for each. To illustrate the
    benefits and pitfall of the differents metrics, we designed different
    presets (binary, multi-class, and two real images captured with OCT and
    fundus). For each preset, we also provide different interactive scenarii.

    However, the tool is thought to provide total freedom to the experimenter.
    Feel free to twist it for your own usecase!
